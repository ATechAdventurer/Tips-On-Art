<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="font-family:&quot;Tempus Sans ITC&quot;">There
is something more profound about how buildings effect people; good buildings are
buildings that move you.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They have
certain qualities about them and that quality has something to do with the
people who built them and the spirit they put into it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>It seemed it would reflect their energy. I didnt understand that at
first  intuitively I knew something was there.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>That had him choose a craft... he chose metalwork.<o:p>

Type Of Artist Do You See Yourself As?<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="font-family:&quot;Eras Demi ITC&quot;;font-weight:normal">I
call myself an architect and a craftsman or artisan  a blacksmith. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="font-size:16.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;

Did You Get Here?<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="font-family:&quot;Eras Demi ITC&quot;;font-weight:normal">Not
trained as an artist but trained as an architect, Lars points out my desire
to understand architecture is what has driven my understanding of how art and
craft integrates into architecture.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
like to work with my hands  architecture involves building but typically an
architect doesnt get involved with the actual building.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>That was what really interested him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>After graduating from college, Lars worked initially with craftspeople.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>He went from a field engineer on a big building to working with a
carpenter, a cabinetmaker, a welder and in a sheet metal shop.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>He comments how it helped him understand the relationship
between what architects do; to understand the translation, integration and
process as design becomes brick and mortar.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>It is important for him to understand the integration between idea and
execution.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="font-family:&quot;Eras Demi ITC&quot;;font-weight:normal">I
figured in my mind that if I was going to understand craftsmanship or artisianry,
I needed to become one with it somehow; to really get into the material,
understand it more profoundly, and see where it went.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>In that process, now I realize that the energy that is put into the
material physically manifests itself in the hammer mark or in the form  then
it is radiated back.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>It is reflected in how people respond to it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The response is what everybody has in common, although it may be a
different response.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="font-family:&quot;Eras Demi ITC&quot;;font-weight:normal">People
respond to an art object or a building or a space that has certain qualities
like this universally.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It is a
universal language.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>So that was
really intriguing to me and that is what led me to pursue the metal work, to
understand that connect better.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But
it wasnt a deliberate intellectual decision.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>It involved that, but initially it was an intuitive path or decision to
follow.<o:p>
</o:p>

<p class="MsoBodyText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="font-family:&quot;Eras Demi ITC&quot;;font-weight:normal">His
mentors are his parents.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>His mother
is an artist.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Lars is clear that
she taught him the patience of sticking with a project even though it was
frustrating. His dad is an architect.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Lars
has worked with him since he was ten years old.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>His dad would point out the craftsmanship of the buildings in El Paso,
where he grew up; the brick joints uniformity from tooling, their work and
their care.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The kinds of things
that, when you stand back, you dont recognize why it strikes you you just
think this building is neat.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>You become aware, aware of the energy.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="font-family:&quot;Eras Demi ITC&quot;;font-weight:normal">There
were other mentors also.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Texas A
&amp; M professor John Ferry made him aware of the process of doing things and
the effect of doing it and the intent.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Doing
something you intend to be a certain way and you work at that.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Then it is translated back.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="font-family:&quot;Eras Demi ITC&quot;;font-weight:normal">Sculptor
Alex Weygers (<a href="http://www.alexweygers.com/"><span style="font-family:
&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">http://www.alexweygers.com/</span></a>), in
California, whom Lars studied blacksmithing with taught him through his
lifestyle.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Alex was trained as an
engineer but that was not where his love was.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>After working as an engineer for a while, he quit.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Moving to California to live on some land, he declared that he was going
to be a sculptor; then proceeded to study with a sculptor.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Alex would say, you know the important thing here is to figure out
what you love to do.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Dont you worry about fame, money or any of these
intellectual aberrations and pursue the love; that other stuff will happen.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>If it doesnt happen immediately, you continue to do it because you
love it and get over the differences that arise no matter what you are doing.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="font-family:&quot;Eras Demi ITC&quot;;font-weight:normal">Charles
Moore, when teaching at the University of Texas at Austin graduate school,
taught me how to appreciate architecture and human energy on a larger
scale.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Buildings are
receptacles of human energy  energy of the artist or the architect designing
the space, the banker that provides the money or the zoning codes that locate
it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The buildings are the
receptacles and they reflect this energy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>When
you are aware of this, you can use this and create a building that has a
beneficial energy; to affect people in the world positively.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>That is an important concept to understand  a difficult one to
understand.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Lars points out that
Charles conveyed this concept with very few words and through travel study
programs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He would also bring
people in to speak to the students that had affected him personally.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>One such person that stands out in Lars mind is J. B. Jackson, a New
England philosopher and landscape journalist whose focus was to understand the
landscape and the highway.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Lars
describes J. B. as an 80 year old man who lectured at Harvard and at Berkley,
constantly on the move between the two coasts, 5 ft. 2 inches tall and riding a
big motorcycle.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He was a story
teller about travels who moved to New Mexico and worked at a filling station
in Santa Fe.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Lars recalls J.B.
always being anxious to return home to his job, to the dismay of all the
students.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>J.B. would clarify that
at the filling station, he would clean travelers tires and windshield, pump
gas, etc.  This is how I study the road.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I ask people where they have been, what their experiences were and get a
chance to understand the vehicle better.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>He would gather the information and write these incredible stories and
use it in his lectures.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>For
Lars, it was good to see someone who didnt feel they had to pursue a
traditional path that we are given because it seems like the right thing
to do  like working for a big firm if you are going to be an architect.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>J. B. made his own program and made a big impact on people.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>You can make up your own program, and when you do, all these wonderful
things happen.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="font-family:&quot;Eras Demi ITC&quot;;font-weight:normal">Charles
Moore also brought in Kent Bloomer (<a href="http://www.bloomerstudio.com/"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">http://www.bloomerstudio.com/</span></a>),
who taught the language of ornament at Yale.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Bloomer pointed out why ornament evolved in human history and how
important the craftsman was to ornament.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Metalwork
was a part of that.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Lars reminds
us that the buildings at the University of Texas have much ornament and symbols
that are archetypes to their meaning and use.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>He opened our eyes to it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It
would be elitist to say we dont need that today in our modern world.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span> We miss out on a lot of power and profoundness because it is easy to
intellectualize it out when it is more difficult to understand that.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Thats why I do it Lars comments.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="font-family:&quot;Eras Demi ITC&quot;;font-weight:normal">Clearly
Lars inspiration also comes from the client and the situation I am dealing
with; the environment I am dealing with.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>He uses the recently completed grillwork at the University of Texas tower
as an example.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The students
wanted to reintegrate the tower back into their lives.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The architectural staff at UT needed to address the barrier situation and
wanted an elegant arc.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I used that
concept and refined it  turning it into an exhilarating experience, which
mainly stems from the place.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Up
there, looking out is inspirational.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
tower is meant to be inspirational; the focal point of the campus and the
community  a sacred place.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Part
of what Lars and his team had to deal with was to release the catastrophic
history of the tower so it didnt dominate the feeling up in the tower and
then re-express the tower and possession of it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Creating a transforming experience, like the education you are
supposed to get at UT  it is a powerful symbol.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Lars points out that the barrier they created was nothing glamorous.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Intuitively you know what to do, what to pursue.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>You have to learn that on your own and they worked with the original
details of the building to create a barrier that releases some energy through a
collaborative process.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="font-family:&quot;Eras Demi ITC&quot;;font-weight:normal">Lars
goes on to comment, the artist is one of the few members of society that does
deal with his intuition; does deal with these more ancient concepts that our
more intellectual Western society has rejected.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>The artist and the artisan become the elite as the
interpreters of that.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Our society
is transforming as we see the value of the artisan again in comparison to
Renaissance times.<o:p>

can do it both ways.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>My interests
have developed to see how the metal affects the design instead of forcing my
will and having it look like something else.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Lars prefers an integration of the idea and the material.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The Zilker Gardens entrance gate is a good example.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The gate needed to be representative of all the garden groups (of which
there are more than 100).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In a
programming effort with all of them, the live oak tree was the most
representative plant of all the groups at this certain place in this time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Lars allowed the process of forging to dictate how the plant was formed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>He made a tool that would make impressions in the steel and spread it at
the same time; the spreading of the steel would naturally curve it, which would
allow him to duplicate the form and the essence of the leaf.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>But it was abstracted and immediate.<o:p>

abstraction of a cast iron plant and a reed are examples he showed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

forging process in particular.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>You
heat the metal up; it becomes white hot; you work it and when you are working
it, you are very much alive, very much aware of what you are doing if you

you have to practice, practice, practice.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>After
you practice, like anything else, your intuition adopts the knowledge about it

were expensive so he thought he would make his own.<span style="mso-spacerun:

</span>As he recalls, The Making of Tools by Alexander G. Weygers,
presented itself.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The book was
about taking old scrap steel, old springs and making tools.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Thats what got me on the road to making metalwork.<o:p>

<p class="MsoBodyText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="font-family:&quot;Eras Demi ITC&quot;;font-weight:normal">Over
the years, finding tools has helped Lars appreciate that tools are extensions
of the human mind.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They allow
you to interact with nature and with materials as extensions of your hands.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Tools are the saving grace of Western society because we have made all
these tools and used our intellect and praised logic and reason  with the
computer being the ultimate tool. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>But
back to the essence of the tool, it is a real intuitive and a spiritual thing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="font-family:&quot;Eras Demi ITC&quot;;font-weight:normal">Tools
are a profound thing, Lars admits.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Blacksmithing
tools hold expressions of an ever more profound reality for Lars.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>They are like sculptures of their own.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Take, for instance, the shape of the anvil, which has evolved over
centuries.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>One blacksmith started out with just a stone; another
understood how to cast bronze to make an anvil so you could get a corner and he
cast it into a square.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Then they
learned about steel so they put a horn on it so you could get round shapes; then
added a little step because another needed to add a certain bend.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Then they put a hole in it so you could punch into the steel.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The anvil is now a record of human ingenuity from intuitive reactions to
nature, to the material.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>All the
tools are like that.<o:p>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="font-family:&quot;Eras Demi ITC&quot;;font-weight:normal">The
old power hammer in Lars shop, made in 1951, is one of his main tools and
they dont make this model any more.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>There are new ones invented that run off compressed air that are also
wonderful, but were not available in the 70s when I was getting started.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Lars had to find his tools in scrap piles of industrial companies and had
restored them to get them going again.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>His
air hammer came from a scrap yard in San Angelo where it had been retired when
blacksmithing became obsolete in the Industrial Age.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

connections serve a practical purpose; they also express an idea and they
reflect an overall understanding of what they are doing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>So, they can create a rhythm, a pattern; they can totally change how you
feel about a space or product.<o:p>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="font-family:&quot;Eras Demi ITC&quot;;font-weight:normal">The
UT tower is a perfect example.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
connections a lot of the time are all you have to work with.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>They wanted to reflect the connections already on campus, the heritage of
the campus.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Their scale and rhythm
help to alleviate the fact that it is a barrier.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Then it becomes a screen or latticework you look through.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>In a way, it releases you from being aware of this barrier to the view
beyond.<span style="mso-spacerun:

traditional blacksmithing connections  riveted connections or collar banded
connections.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They are so strong
and so direct  a powerful composition.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
scale of the band and the method used and how tight it is all matters in the

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="font-family:&quot;Eras Demi ITC&quot;;font-weight:normal">A
design project is a door handle or designing a school, they have similar
threads, and Lars enjoys doing both of them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>He sees them being very related.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Both
need to reflect who he is and who the client is.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Thats why they come to me and want it to reflect a certain quality.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Certain social aspirations, ideas and feelings will be generated.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>If you are not aware of that, the things that will dominate will be the
politics of it and the economics of it  zoning, codes  all part of that
energy to be resolved.<span style="mso-spacerun:

<p class="MsoBodyText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="font-family:&quot;Eras Demi ITC&quot;;font-weight:normal">I
follow the process I learned in architecture school.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>First step is information gathering/programming.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>To talk to the client, go see the site, understand the requirements and
objectives, their aspirations.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>From
that process, ideas pop up.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
client always has an idea of what is going to move them  what moved them
about my work because they have seen something and it appeals to them in a
certain way.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>That draws something out from me and I will do sketches.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Sometimes I get them to do some sketches.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>It evolves.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Ideas come that
way.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="font-family:&quot;Eras Demi ITC&quot;;font-weight:normal">I
will go into the design phase.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Schematic
design comes up with some schemes through sketches that try to express the
inspirations that evolved; two or three options.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>The client will then look at them; we will talk about them
and refine it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>That will evolve
into the design that we settle on.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Through
design development, Lars includes his client in the process because he values
their energy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They are an
important part of it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
final design is reflective of a budget that affects the connections, etc.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="font-family:&quot;Eras Demi ITC&quot;;font-weight:normal">Next
step is to set the price, set the time frame, and start.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Lars has a team of people that he works with in his shop and he has also
collaborates with other shops if the scope of the project dictates it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>He will show his in-house team what he wants by forging an example and
having them practice till it is reflective of his example; till it becomes an
intuitive process.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As long as the
intent is captured, Lars allows the team he is mentoring to gain valuable
experience to fulfill their purpose for working with him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I invest in them to the extent that they learn how to do something, do
these processes which helps them and it helps me so I can work on several
things.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He is there along the
whole way and he encourages questions.<o:p>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="font-family:&quot;Eras Demi ITC&quot;;font-weight:normal">Lars

society addresses it in the more intellectual aspects of it by suggesting we use
certain materials to not, for instance, use up a lot of BTUs (British Thermal
Unit, or amount of energy) to extract from the earth  principles like
that.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Those are very
important, but I think art deals with these other principles that are just as

Talk About Making Multiples Of A Creative Effort As A Part Of Your Business.<o:p>

</span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="font-family:&quot;Eras Demi ITC&quot;;font-weight:normal">Lars
work is primarily commission based.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He
has not really gotten into making multiples of a product type as a business
base.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He does concur, however, that
there are a few pieces he has made with that intent  some candle holders, for
example.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Other business continues
to come in that does not leave him time to develop that, although he says he
likes the aspect of multiples.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>One
of the best reasons is an understanding I gained by reading The Unknown
Craftsman: A Japanese Insight into Beauty. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>In
there he talks about the vessels made by Korean potters that inspired the
Japanese tea ceremony and the notion of the unknown craftsman being the purveyor
of the wisdom of the culture.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
first person in Korea that made these tea vessels taught other people in his
village how to do this.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>People in
that village would move and teach another village until there was this whole
region of people who created these vessels that have a wonderful spontaneous
expression of their spirit and their wisdom.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The wisdom came from some artist or combination of artists who said this
is how we make these things; this is how we interact with this clay, and this is
how we are expressing who we are to the world.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The Japanese loved this, tried to copy it, and it evolved into a tea
ceremony where the vessel is so important.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>It becomes an object of energy to them where the detail and glaze are all
important.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Korean craft people and
artists were actually a representation of the wisdom and inspiration of their
whole culture.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Even though it could
have been made by a child or a very old person, the spirit of how they made it
was conveyed through the original artist.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Over
time, it evolved and changed with the input of each artist.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>It expressed each person, but it also expressed the original idea.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The author of The Unknown Craftsman: a Japanese Insight into
Beauty, was trying to make the point that everyone doesnt have to be this
profound artist; you dont have to recreate this original art  that is a
Western notion.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>All these people
are heroes who are making these repetitive things.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>But they are not repetitive because they are handmade and express the
human individual.  A very positive way to look at repetition!<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="font-family:&quot;Eras Demi ITC&quot;;font-weight:normal">The
notion that stands out for Lars in this philosophy is that the vessels were
made without any pretense; without a lot of intellectualizing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The child would learn how to do it from the master and it was quick.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>It was the joyful expression that was quick as the child would do another
one; it was not labored upon.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>That
notion of doing it quickly and trying to capture the essence of the material and
idea was what helped guide Lars to develop the idea of the leaf process for the
Zilker Gardens entrance gate.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It
reflected the artist, the material and the process.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>You can see that in architecture too; like cathedrals that may have been
constructed by farmers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Making
repetitive things can express that same idea.<o:p>

is very interested in school design.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Franklin
High School in El Paso, Texas, is one facility where he was able to bring some
of his ideas and philosophies into the design of that school; focusing on plazas
and student spaces that encourage community and interaction for social
sustainability  a Renaissance concept that is time tested.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Lars is very proud of this project and wants to do more like it to
positively effect our world with his principles of sustainable techniques and
get the budgets to incorporate functions like gray-water systems, rainwater
collection systems, natural lighting, xeriscaping, etc.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The most important thing is the spaces in the building being part of
the kids lives and their day to day impact them in a beneficial way.<o:p>

</span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="font-family:&quot;Eras Demi ITC&quot;;font-weight:normal">On
a trip back to the school, Lars discovered a wonderful social feature that
evolved as Franklin High students became integrated with the structure.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>It had to do with the entrance/parent drop off area.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Tons of kid were on the benches, planters and steps around this loop.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>It was a ritual to initiate the freshmans transition to sophomores.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The kids had to go around this parent loop backwards on all fours with a
spoon and an egg without dropping it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>If
dropped, they had to start over till they made it as the rest of the school
cheers them on in this race.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>That
wasnt part of the design program, Lars commented, and yet it was wonderful
to see.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>They had taken possession of this building and it was an
alive space.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>If there had not been
these benches, planters and steps in that space, then perhaps, that would not
have happened and this social opportunity turned tradition would be missed.<o:p>

<p class="MsoBodyText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="font-family:&quot;Eras Demi ITC&quot;;font-weight:normal">Another
example of social sharing at the same school is the flagpole in the middle of
that same loop.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>While kids are
waiting for their parents after school, the ROTC kids come and take the flag
down while everyone can watch  another daily ritual integrated into their
gathering.<o:p>
