<p><h3><a name="#mf"></a>Mark Falkin</h3>Hummmm�. *scratches chin, furrows brow* I believe art is what we mine from the torrent of our lives. Art is the unavoidable polyphonic voice of the soul. Some suppress it. Others embrace it. Everyone is capable of it. I happen to believe it is an absolute mandate of life: Express yourself. Thus, art is one of the foci of my life. Everyday, directly or indirectly, I experience art, create it, or help it along. My day job and spare time are taken up by art. During the work-a-day, I am legal counsel to small businesses, artists and entertainers to help them achieve their various visions. For the last few years, I have been a songwriting member and vocalist in an original rock band. However, the forms of art which interest me most are fiction writing and poetry. I take cracks at these disciplines in my exercise of the Mandate. My continued involvement in TIPS On Art is exciting to me in that it represents a constant opportunity to both allow Austin to further spread its cultural wings and for me, and for everyone who touches the project, to add their own navigational coordinates to that potential flight.</p>

<p><h3><a name="#aw"></a>Adolph Wetegrove</h3>Adolph has discovered that he receives the greatest satisfaction in life by helping others reach their goals. He believes art is a way of expressing and sharing feelings by creating art and by viewing art.  He's involved in TIPS because it fulfills his needs in helping others to discover art in themselves. Adolph believes we are all artists; some are just waiting to come out.  For his day job he builds things - decks, repairs broken doors, patches walls or whatever is on the "need to fix" list.  He also sings Bass/Baritone for the Austin Lyric Opera Chorus.</p>

<p><h3><a name="#dw"></a>Donna Wetegrove - Founder of the vision for TIPS On Art � </h3>Donna holds a unique perspective that collaboration, mentoring and creativity conquers much in society as a whole and local communities in particular.  A professional, licensed commercial Interior Designer, she has evolved her skills for facilitating creative solutions to the built environment since 1981.  With a message of "Buy Art", she is a proponent for proactive consumption of all things as functional art in all areas of life � spending your dollar where it gains you the most pleasure for all five senses and offers timeless enjoyment.</p><p>Having started an incredible journey with the vision for TIPS On Art in 1995, it has truly proven to be a journey about the process as much as a measurable outcome.  By providing pro bono design and product procurement services to see East Austin's Manos de Cristo Dental & Medical Clinic and The Jack Sansing HIV Dental Clinic to fruition, Donna understands the power of what grassroots community efforts are capable of.  Also a long time annual supporter of homeless and low income family solutions, she brings a collaborative approach to community oriented networks for goal oriented outcomes such as financial & food support, clothing, household repairs and products � and most important, relationship.</p><p>Creative interests stretch far to include metal working, mixed media collage, landscaping, cuisine, color theory, holistic thinking and all things related to a healthy built environment.  It is the culmination of these interests along with business and life experience skills that gave rise to the concept of a district destination in Austin, Texas that would bring people together through creativity and simple pleasures in life � an opportunity for discovery and sharing � TIPS On Art.</p>
