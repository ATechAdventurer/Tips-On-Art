It is only $30.00 more than the normal registration fee and can be personalized.  Best of all, the proceeds bring arts programs, education, and performances to communities across the state and provide funding to artists in every field, from every background, for all art forms.  Remember, you don't have to wait until the registration on your current plates expire.  You may apply for this special plate at any time during the year and your regular registration fees will be prorated.  ACT NOW!  For more information on how to order your work of art, call the Texas Commission on the Arts at 1.800.252.9415 or go online at <a href="http://www.arts.state.tx.us/lp/home.asp" target="new">http://www.arts.state.tx.us/lp/home.asp</a> to download an application.  Did you know that the State of the Arts license plates has sold more plates than all 48 collegiate plate designs combined?</p>
