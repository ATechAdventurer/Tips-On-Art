<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">From this writers perspective, following is an in depth
view of some of the significant stages that occurred in the development of ALOs
1999-2000 season production of Aida:</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">COSTUME FITTINGS (2.16.00):</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><a href="Cost1.jpg"><img border="2" src="Cost1_small.jpg" align="middle" alt="Cost1.jpg (39836 bytes)" width="100" height="63"></a></p>
</font>
<p ALIGN="left"><i><font face="Humnst777 Lt BT" size="1">ALO staff at initial
fitting session</font></i></p>
<font FACE="Humnst777 Lt BT" SIZE="2">
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Kate, Ann &amp; Paula are pivotal players from the ALO staff
in the costuming process. Since most of the costumes are rented for this
production, they usually try to get them about the same time musical rehearsals
start. Ahead of the actual fittings, staff is presorting costumes to the cast
member list. For Aida, costumes actually came direct from the last production
rental so they were still dirty. Minnesota Opera sent someone to Austin to help
with the cleaning process. Many of the costumes are made of raw silk so the
cleaning process must be intentionally handled to preserve their character and
quality.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;The bible&quot;(see photo) of all costumes included
with the production rental was actually available to Kate, Ann &amp; Paula at
the beginning of this season (which was Oct/Nov. 99). Ann was charged with
preassigning costumes for this production as well as the previous production of
Candide. There were six (6) crates of costumes total for Aida. This is a big
show! Also, unusual to this show, the production costumes include wigs for the
chorus, shoes, ladies bustles &amp; undergarments, etc.  all the details that
capture the period of the costuming.</p>

Open crate at fitting session.</font></i></p>
<font FACE="Humnst777 Lt BT" SIZE="2">
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">ALO staff set up certain days that chorus members can sign up
for times to be fitted. Each session allows twenty minutes with each person to
handle the volume. In Aida, with and excess of seventy (70) chorus members and
twelve (12) supers (non-singing &quot;extras&quot;), six (6) days are dedicated
to fittings.</p>

Wig fittings are also an important part of the process.</font></i></p>
<font FACE="Humnst777 Lt BT" SIZE="2">
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At the fitting sessions, each cast member tries on as many
costumes as they are cast for so staff can evaluate additional needs including
hems. The staff does all their alterations at ALOs Scene Shop until they can
move into the theater  usually the week before the scenery goes up (1 
weeks before the production opens). In this case, setting up in the basement at
Bass Concert Hall allows the staff to complete their alterations and be prepared
for all the unexpected things that can show up in a live production setting.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">STAGING REHEARSAL (2.23.00):</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><a href="Rehearse1.jpg"><img border="2" src="Rehearse1_small.jpg" alt="Rehearse1.jpg (42467 bytes)" width="100" height="66"></a>

<p ALIGN="left"><i><font face="Humnst777 Lt BT" size="1">Putting movement to the
music&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hydraulics move the center of the
stage set.</font></i></p>
<font FACE="Humnst777 Lt BT" SIZE="2">
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Time is short. So many people to manage  one of the
largest chorus productions with multiple supers and dancers too. It is hard to
manage the chatter with so many bodies. Tension is at the cusp of every
interaction as crucial timing elements and cues are refined. The alternate cast
is performing tonight. Austin Lyric Opera traditionally employs two principle
casts to support their currently dense performance schedule (four nights in a
row). The scenes are being timed for information sharing with the stage crew
once the production moves into Bass next week. The principle cast is becoming
familiar with the interaction with the chorus movements. The set itself presents
many challenges with its multitude of steps and its center portion that
hydraulically works in the round. Susan Threadgill, stage manager, takes a
moment to caution all chorus members that swift movements without contact or
pushing other members is imperative for everyones safety. The lighting
designer, David Nancarrow, joins rehearsal tonight as he works to fine tune his
design concept and timing prior to moving into the theater.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All staging rehearsals are accompanied with piano. Maestro
Kellogg leads each rehearsal musically. Working in concert with the director for
all movement requirements. It is imperative that all principles and choristers
have a line of site to the Maestro for music cues and maintaining the general
pace of the opera  <i>very important</i>.</p>

<p ALIGN="left"><i><font face="Humnst777 Lt BT" size="1">Offstage positions
being rehearsed</font></i></p>
<font FACE="Humnst777 Lt BT" SIZE="2">
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Assistant Conductor &amp; Chorus Master, Julian Reed,
continually briefs the chorus on off stage positions and provides feedback on
diction and overall sound quality. For off stage coordination, Julian must have
a line of sight either personally or electronically to the Maestros direction
to assure proper timing as well. One cannot trust their ear back stage or else
sound will be behind that of the orchestra and singers on stage.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Tonight, an initial effort at staging for the curtain call is
even attempted. It is two minutes till quitting time  it all counts! Groups
are called according to how they are seen on stage during the production.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">SITZPROBE (a musical examination of <i>all</i> aspects of the
opera while seated the whole time  without any staging action)(2.27.00):</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><a href="sitz1.jpg"><img border="2" src="sitz1_small.jpg" hspace="15" alt="sitz1.jpg (45266 bytes)" width="100" height="104"></a><a href="sitz2.jpg"><img border="2" src="sitz2_small.jpg" hspace="40" alt="sitz2.jpg (34343 bytes)" width="100" height="102"></a><a href="sitz3.jpg"><img border="2" src="sitz3_small.jpg" hspace="40" alt="sitz3.jpg (68208 bytes)" width="100" height="99"></a></p>

<p ALIGN="left"><i><font face="Humnst777 Lt BT" size="1">ALO chorus at
sitzprobe&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Maestro Cal Stewart Kellogg&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&quot;AIDA&quot; played by Priscila Bakerville</font></i></p>
<font FACE="Humnst777 Lt BT" SIZE="2">
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Once again, for this particularly large show, the music room
at UT is brimming with chorus, orchestra, principle singers, ALOs general
director, maestro, chorus master and a special horn section in the upper
&quot;balcony&quot; (a space that rarely is needed at sitzprobe). This very full
room is balanced acoustically for this first time that <i>all </i>participants
get to hear and interact with each other musically. ... quite a spectacular
event in its own right. It is a working session so Maestro takes advantage of
natural pauses and changes in the music to request refinements and check in with
principle singers as to their comfort with the piece before progressing. The
sound is so full due to the size of the room. A true working session that
certainly presents glimpses of the glory that will be experienced in the theater
when the layer of the set is added in less than one week.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The orchestra is arranged traditionally in a semicircle at
the front of the room around Maestro, as they will be in the orchestra pit. Next
is the line of principle singers; then the chorus  arranged in music
rehearsal format with the sections grouped together for tonal support (even
though on stage, many times choristers are isolated and must still carry the
same vocal strength). Sopranos to the left; altos (or mezzo-sopranos) &amp;
tenors, tenors &amp; baritones in the center; basses to the right.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Professionalism is all that is tolerated in this time. Each
participant <u>must</u> come prepared. Missed entrances, poor tonal quality 
lack of confidence is not tolerated. Errors are a waste of time and time wasted
equates to an expensive loss if everyone cannot progress through the entire
opera.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is awe inspiring to think what each ear in the room is
listening for to assure their role. It is as a stone carver looks at a piece of
stone and interprets its intended outcome. Opera is a layered medium and every
layer must be represented in the crescendos and diminuendos.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The entire time is calculated  even the breaks. When
reconvened (precisely 20 minutes), the pace is picked up at exactly where it
left off  like a well-oiled machine. In all this seriousness, you can still
see amazing camaraderie between the singers. There are plenty of smiles,
gestures of support and lots of applause for jobs well done. It is amazing to
witness the power of the human voice, of opera. You can <u>feel</u> the story in
the strength of the whole. You dont have to love opera to fall in love with
the commitment of these individuals and experience their humanness. Like a drop
of water in the ocean, the power of the whole is magnificent and what the
audience will witness in Bass Concert Hall in one week from now.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When at rest during sitzprobe, you see chorus and principals
reading a book, the paper  lots of crossword puzzles, some follow along with
the music score. And yet, when time to sing, they are on purpose and attentive.
Looking to Maestro for their cues. With all the rehearsals, the score has become
second nature to them by now.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">An interesting thought to contemplate, here is Verdis
music, written in the 18<sup>th</sup> century, and yet there is much room for
Maestros interpretation for moments held to accommodate the music and
accentuate singers personal styles. Subtle differences can be noticed between
the two principal casts as one educates their ear. It is up to each participant
of the orchestra and chorus to remember where Maestro calls these queues and
support them through each performance. And the subtleties are incredible.
Maestro can ask and receive exactly what he wants. The orchestra, as a whole,
responds as a single actor to a director  truly beautiful to witness in its
progression. The point of opera is to carry emotions along with a story. ... not
to intimidate, not to overrule. To come simply to listen  to be moved, to
perhaps fall in love is the place to start and hold on to. There is much
education available to support the love  as with anything. You dont have
to know it all.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><a href="bass1.jpg"><img border="2" src="bass1_small.jpg" hspace="15" alt="bass1.jpg (45433 bytes)" width="100" height="67"></a><a href="bass2.jpg"><img border="2" src="bass2_small.jpg" hspace="15" alt="bass2.jpg (46744 bytes)" width="100" height="66"></a><a href="bass3.jpg"><img border="2" src="bass3_small.jpg" hspace="15" alt="bass3.jpg (39346 bytes)" width="100" height="64"></a></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">After a dinner break, chorus members, principles, supers and
dancers convene in the theater to experience their first run through with the
enormous ALO signature falcon on stage. Quite an amazing sight! Here cues are
refined to allow for proper entrances and exits with the wings, curtain drops,
all the props, etc. Seeing the bird in motion with the center circle of the
stage on hydraulics is a very striking moment ... one that allows you to
experience the glorious wing span of the bird. Since staging rehearsals included
the steps and turntable of the stage set, refinements at this point in
rehearsals is much more advanced than the normal expectation for this first
night in the theater.</p>
