			<h3>Shifting boundaries.<br>Bridging cultures.<br>Crossing mediums.</h3><br>
			<p>Art Matters. Art shifts boundaries and bridges cultures. Some art mixes mediums; some art shocks and
				surprises. Good art awakens the everyday to the potential for great beauty.</p>
			<p>TIPS On Art is a not-for-profit arts-based service organization. We seek to grow and connect the Austin
				art community with the everyday lives of the people in it. Austin's heart and soul has always been
				creative, if not a little untamed. As a community we have yet to cultivate these passions and give them
				a place to flourish. We have a "scene" but we are still struggling to have a culture. Art has the power
				to communicate to all kinds of people on many different levels, to enlighten, to raise up, to connect.
				We think Austin is ready for this enlightenment, and we have a plan.</p>
			<p>We've mapped out an on-going series of visual arts <a href="/programs/exhibitions.html">exhibitions</a>
				to provide business opportunities and exposure for artists. Our plan includes cultural integration for
				visitors, students, businesses and artists, in interactive public spaces. We've developed special <a
					href="/news_events/">events</a>, such as concerts, readings and theatrical performances to
				enlighten and challenge the community. At the core of our organization, our <a
					href="/programs/">programs</a> educate, inspire and entertain.</p>
			<p>We have a big vision that includes plans for a <a href="/facility/">facility</a> that will become the
				cornerstone of an arts district and serve as a cultural destination for Austinites and visitors alike.
				We see a permanent home for numerous local artists, arts organizations and creative-based businesses.
				And we see community involvement. Your <a href="/be_involved/">involvement</a> is fundamental to our
				success.</p>
